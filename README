lsdrv - Report on a system's disk interfaces and how they are used.

This script shows a system administrator the details of the block devices
in a system, organized by subsystem and interface and displayed in a tree.
Where possible, serial numbers and unique IDs are displayed in braces to
document the setup. The hierarchy looks like:

Controller {serial}
 └─Physical Device {serial}
    └─Block Device {uuid}
       └─Partition {uuid}
          └─Layered Device {uuid}
             └─LVM Volume Group {uuid}
                └─LVM Logical Volume {uuid}
                   └─Mount point

System utilities 'lspci' and/or 'lsusb' are used to describe the
controller, with fallback to an abbreviated form of the sysfs path.

Sysfs properties and the system utilities 'ata_id', 'sginfo' and/or
'smartctl' are used to decribe the physical device.

Sysfs properties and the system utilities 'vol_id' or 'blkid' are used
to describe the generic block devices and the partitions or other layered
devices they contain (except for LVM).

System utilities 'pvs' and 'lvs' are used to describe block devices that
are physical volumes in the LVM subsystem.

Missing utilities are noted, but the script attempts to continue without
them.
